  <h1>My Story</h1>
  <p>My name is Billy and I am a sophmore at Tucker High School. I first started coding when I was in seventh grade. I've always wanted to keep coding but I never had the opportunity to do it again. Coding is a hobby of mine but it's not my only hobby. I enjoy playing sports such as basketball, football, and soccer (mostly basketball). I am hoping to take this class to enhance my coding skills and to see if this is something I want to pursue in the future.</p>
