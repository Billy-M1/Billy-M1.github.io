  <p class="aboutme">
     My name is Billy and I am a sophmore at Tucker High School. I first started coding when I was in seventh grade. I've always wanted to keep coding but I never had the opportunity to do it again. Coding is a hobby of mine but it's not my only hobby. I enjoy playing sports such as basketball, football, and soccer (mostly basketball). I am hoping to take this class to enhance my coding skills and to see if this is something I want to pursue in the future. I am also hoping to be exposed to a lot of new things that I wasn't when I first coded. I am also looking forward to increasing my network while at Refcode. I am also excited to make my own website that I can share with friends and family.
